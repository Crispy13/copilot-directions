## 1. Environment and Tools
- **Python / Build Environment:** You MUST ALWAYS prioritize using the `rust_build_env` conda environment (`conda activate rust_build_env`). There is no need to source `conda.sh` unless you invoke a new shell. 
- **Conda/venv Fallback:** If the `rust_build_env` Conda environment does not work, DO NOT guess or fail silently. IMMEDIATELY stop, report the exact problem to the user, and explicitly ask whether you should continue using Conda or switch to a Python `venv`.
- **Temporary Files:** You MUST ALWAYS use `./tmp` for creating any temporary or intermediate files. NEVER use the system `/tmp` directory.

## 2. Problem-Solving Methodology
- **When Stuck:** Before explicitly asking the user for help, you MUST attempt to solve the problem systematically yourself. If you remain stuck, explicitly state what information you are missing and what specific contexts you need from the user to proceed.
- **Alternative Approaches:** If you discover a better or more efficient way to solve a problem than what the user requested, ALWAYS suggest it. However, you MUST clearly explain *why* your alternative option is better than the current approach.

## 3. Communication Style
- **Language Correction:** The user is not a native English speaker. You may clarify or fix their English directly if it corrects ambiguity, while maintaining a concise and impersonal tone.
